**Key Word: Cluster Analysis, Python, Google Maps API**

##Introduction

This project analyze taxi data in New York City. It uses cluster anaysis to identify the locations with most pick-ups, and the most lucrative trips. The results are presented using google mpas API. It can help taxi drivers to determine where they should wait for the passengers. 

##Data
NYC cab data is available from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission’s Trip Record Data site: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml. 

The city is composed from 5 boroughs — Manhattan, and the four 'outer boroughs', Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island. Named for the exterior paint colour, there are two types of taxis in New York City, yellow and green. The yellow-painted taxis (“yellow cabs”) are allowed to pick up willing customers from the streets in Manhattan but not from the outer boroughs. Green taxis, so-called “Borough cabs” are allowed to do the same in the outer boroughs but not in Manhattan.

In the demonstration code, March 2016 'Green' data is used.
